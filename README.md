# Portfolio Minimal

A clean single-page portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases:

- responsive navigation with a hamburger trigger for smaller screens
- a light/dark theme toggle that swaps between sun-and-moon styles
- project cards that link to GitHub repos and live demos (Bakery Management System, AI Chatbot, E-commerce Application)
- scroll-to-top control and skill tags powered by utility-focused CSS classes
